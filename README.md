# VooNew

V2, a bit cleaner.  

## What

This is the technical test for the role of App's founding engineer test for Voodoo (https://www.voodoo.io/).

Voonew is an app that encourages you to share your day!  
This is of course a POC more than anything, but the main gist is that each day, you can see what your friends shared. You can also share your day by adding pictures taken today!  

The main elements are called "Journals" and are a collaborative effort (not really but ideally they would be). You can create a journal and your friends can share their memories with you in that journal.  

In the profile section, you can travel backwards in time and explore all your journals, or your friends'  

## POC and what's next

Obviously this is a very rough POC that is mostly mocked data and does not allow for shared efforts since everything is "fake". I'd like to point out a few ideas I had while making this POC:
- Collaborative features; you can add to your friends' journals and they can add to yours
- Camera; you should be able to take a picture in the app and append it to a journal, or create a new one
- chat; the current one is more of a comments section, but the idea is that each journal should have a "scoped" chat where you can discuss that day with your friends
- A multi-day journal; so that you can for instance work on a trip by adding a new entry each day

## Voodoo notes

This challenge is designed to evaluate your technical skills, creativity, 
and ability to deliver a compelling product in terms of both user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) in a limited time.

You will be working on an app to share photos and chat with friends:
- *User problem*: apps such as Instagram and Snapchat have become public façades where I share highly curated pictures. I can share raw, fun pictures with my friends and chat on apps like WhatsApp, but they’re not really photo-centric.
- *Job to be done*: 1/ share ‘real’ pictures with close friends and chat, 2/ keep a shared collection of common memories.

This project is set up as a bootstrap that you will need to complete within 4 hours.


## Objectives

Your main objectives are to:

- *Implement Core Features:* build out the key functionalities of the photo-centric and chat application.
- *Focus on UI/UX:* design and implement a user interface that is intuitive, simple, and visually appealing. We're looking for innovation in how users interact with the app.
- *Write Clean Code:* ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and performance-optimized.

Feel free to implement any additional features you believe would enhance the application. Bonus functionalities are highly encouraged and welcomed.

## Key Features to Implement

- Photo Gallery: users should be able to view a collection of photos fetched from the Unsplash API (feel free to fix & improve the proposed implementation).
- Photo Selection: implement a creative and user-friendly interface for selecting and sharing photos.
- Chat Interface: design and implement a prototype of a chat feature where users can send messages and share photos (without necessary being connected to a real backend).


## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

- UI/UX Innovation: creativity in the app design and user interaction.
- Technical Proficiency: effective use of iOS technologies and coding best practices.
- Problem Solving: ability to address challenges with efficient solutions.

## Getting Started

- Review the project structure and the placeholders for the core features.
- Implement the features as outlined, focusing on UI/UX and code quality.

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete your work within 4 hours and ensure the project is error-free.
- Document any significant decisions or approaches you took.
- Submit your project via email as a zip file or a GitHub repository link.

Good luck, we're looking forward to reviewing your solution!
